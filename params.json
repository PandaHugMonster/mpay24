There is also a complete and ready to test \"example shop\" available at mPAY24.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nIn order for the mPAY24 PHP API to work, your installation will have to meet the following prerequisites:\r\n\r\n* [PHP >= 5](http://www.php.net/)\r\n* [cURL](http://at2.php.net/manual/de/book.curl.php)\r\n* [DOM](http://at2.php.net/manual/de/book.dom.php)\r\n* [Mcrypt](http://at2.php.net/manual/en/mcrypt)\r\n\r\nPlease refer to http://www.php.net/phpinfo or consult your systems administrator in order to find out if your system fulfills the prerequisites.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
