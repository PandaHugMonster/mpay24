There is also a complete and ready to test \"example shop\" available at mPAY24.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n\r\nIn order for the mPAY24 PHP API to work, your installation will have to meet the following prerequisites:\r\n\r\n* PHP >= 5\r\n* cURL\r\n* DOM\r\n* Mcrypt\r\n\r\nPlease refer to http://www.php.net/phpinfo or consult your systems administrator in order to find out if your system fulfills the prerequisites.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
